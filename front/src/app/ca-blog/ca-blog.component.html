    <h2>What is Chartered Accountant</h2>
    <p>Chartered Accountant is a designation that is given to a professional of accounting who has received
        certification from a statutory body that states he/ she possesses the necessary qualifications to take care of
        the matters related to accounting and taxation of a business. These matters include file tax returns,
        maintaining records of investments, audit financial statements and business practices, preparing and reviewing
        financial documents and reports. A Chartered Accountant is also qualified and capable of offering advisory
        services to clients that comprise companies and individuals.
    </p>
    <p>To become a certified Chartered Accountant, a candidate is required to complete three levels of training that are
        designed by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). It is only after qualifying all the three
        levels that the candidate will be given the designation of a CA. The ICAI is a statutory body which is
        responsible for regulating and maintaining the profession of chartered accountancy in India. The course of
        Chartered Accountancy is completed in roughly five years.</p>
